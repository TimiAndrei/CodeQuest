Dynamic programming (DP) is a powerful algorithmic paradigm used to solve optimization problems efficiently. 
 It is particularly useful for problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. 

 This resource covers:
 - Memoization vs. Tabulation: Understanding top-down (recursion + caching) vs. bottom-up (iterative DP) approaches.
 - Common DP Patterns:
   - Fibonacci sequence and its variations.
   - Knapsack problem and its real-world applications.
   - Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) and Edit Distance.
 - State Transition and Recurrence Relations: Learning to define states, transitions, and base cases for DP problems.
 - Optimization Techniques:
   - Space optimization by reducing memory usage.
   - Using bit masking and optimized loops for efficiency.
   - Parallelizing DP computations for large-scale problems.

 By mastering these techniques, you will improve your ability to solve complex computational problems efficiently. 
 The resource includes multiple practice problems and real-world applications to reinforce learning.
